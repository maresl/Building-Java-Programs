"You will be given a program that runs a simulation of a world with many animals
wandering around in it.  Different kinds of animals will behave in different ways
and you are defining those differences.  In this world, animals propagate their
species by infecting other animals with their DNA, which transforms the other animal
into the infecting animalâ€™s species..."

This class builds Giants within a simulated world that tries to infect other
animals and turn them into more Giants. They display a "fee" "foe" and
"fum" pattern that repeats. They will tend to follow the "walls" of the world
in a clockwise direction.

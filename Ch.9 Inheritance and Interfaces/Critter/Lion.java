"You will be given a program that runs a simulation of a world with many animals
wandering around in it.  Different kinds of animals will behave in different ways
and you are defining those differences.  In this world, animals propagate their
species by infecting other animals with their DNA, which transforms the other animal
into the infecting animalâ€™s species..."

This class builds Lions within a simulated world that try to infect other animals into becoming
more Lions. Every three moves their color changes, randomly choosing between red, blue, and green.
They tend to bounce off the walls- when they encounter a wall they will return the direction they
came from.

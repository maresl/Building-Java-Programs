"You will be given a program that runs a simulation of a world with many animals
wandering around in it.  Different kinds of animals will behave in different ways
and you are defining those differences.  In this world, animals propagate their
species by infecting other animals with their DNA, which transforms the other animal
into the infecting animalâ€™s species..."

This class builds Bears within a simulated world that try to infect other animals to
transform them into more Bears. Each Bears is passed a boolean value that
determine whether that Bear is displayed as either black or white. Display will
alternate between a slash and a backslash. They tend to follow the "walls" of
the world in a counterclockwise direction.
